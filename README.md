* It should be structured as the following:

```

##### Commands:
* **Start**   : `npm start`  - *builds and fires script once*

     

#### Script Requirements / Task
1. Pull all past Shopify Order data from 2016
    - For this I used the 'shopify-api-node' module to handle pulling the data in from Shopify.
    - I used the params `processed_at_min` and `processed_at_max` to find the set constraints of the range.
    - I used `financial_status` and searched for `paid` to retrieve completed orders.

2. For each order, Klaviyo wants two event types: “Placed Order” and “Ordered Product”.
    - Pulled data in from Shopify, then iterated over each order once for “Placed Order” and again for “Ordered Product” over each order and formatted the data into their respective payloads


#### Improvements/Changes
* Tests and logs would be necessary if this was to scale up
